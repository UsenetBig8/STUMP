<CENTER>``Making Moderation Easy'' </CENTER>
<P>
<BR>

Thanks for your interest in STUMP. First of all, I want to put in bold
print the things that are usually referred to as "Fine Print" in the
US.<P>

<B><CENTER>No Purchase Necessary</CENTER><P>

STUMP itself (a computer program) is free. Anyone can download it for
free. There is also a mailing list for STUMP users that is open to any
STUMP user. I also give advice to STUMP users if they send their
questions to the list, even if they did not pay anything to me. I
would rather have non-paying but happy users running their
Net. Communities on their own than a potentially great newsgroup that
did not happen.</B></P>

ReadySTUMP is a commercial service. STUMP site hosting (ReadySTUMP) is
for those individuals and groups who would like to moderate a USENET
newsgroup, but want to avoid spending their valuable time (and money)
on setting up a Unix account, dealing with compilers, perl, procmail,
and so on, and would rather like to concentrate on building their
net.communities.<P>

The following table compares the difference between do-it-yourself and
ReadySTUMP hosting. Decide for yourself whether you want to go on your
own (a good choice for many) or pay for a ReadySTUMP account (a good
choice for many others).<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>

<TR>

<TD><CENTER><B>Do It Yourself</B></CENTER></TD>
<TD><CENTER><B>ReadySTUMP</B></CENTER></TD>

<TR>

<TD>You have to find a provider that would 

  <UL>
    <LI> Give you a Unix shell account
    <LI> Agree that you run a bot from that account
    <LI> Have perl and ability to compile things
    <LI> Be <A HREF=#reliability>reasonably</A> reliable
  </UL>

</TD>

<TD>I set up and customize STUMP for you, usually next day or so. 

<BR>Thanks to our <A HREF=../webstump.html>WebSTUMP</A> interface, you
do not even need to log into the moderation account, unless you need
to do something fancy (end even then I can do most things for you if
you want to).</TD>

<TR>
<TD>You have to know Unix commands on the level of "Unix for Dummies"
<TD>You don't have to know Unix

<TR>
<TD> You may have to pay for a Unix shell account, unless you get it 
     from your current provider or friends. The price of a shell-only
     account is usually around 10-20 dollars per month.
     
<TD> You have to pay for a ReadySTUMP account.

<TR>

<TD> You have to apply upgrades on your own, which again means some
amount of Unix work.<BR><B>NOTE:</B> I do try to make upgrades as easy
as possible for everyone.

<TD> We'll apply upgrades to the software for you for free, if you
want them.

<TR>
<TD> If you want a webpage for your newsgroup, you do it yourself

<TD> I create a <A HREF=http://stump.algebra.com/~mifp> nice
looking web page</A> for you. The web page would contain current
archives of your group if that's what you want. These archives will be
regularly updated.<P>

Look at <A HREF=http://stump.algebra.com/~mifp>http://stump.algebra.com/~mifp</A><P>

Also, I believe that moderators should derive tangible (as well as
emotional) benefits from their work. I therefore believe that these
web sites offer the moderators a good opportunity to advertise
themselves, as well as their business. For example, moderators of
software newsgroups may advertise their consulting services, whereas
moderators of recreational newsgroups may make easy money by selling
related books through <A HREF=http://www.amazon.com> Amazon.com</A>'s
reseller program.<P>

Such websites offer an excellent opportunity to host FAQs and
charters.  With STUMP, you can advertise your Web site in every
approved message.

<TR>
<TD> You can set up optional <A HREF=../webstump.html>WebSTUMP</A>
interface, which requires knowledge of HTML and CGI, and the ability
to run CGI scripts on your server. WebSTUMP allows moderators to
moderate their newsgroups through easy Web interface, with any Web browser
such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer</A>. But setting it up 
requires access to a web server, some knowledge of CGI and perl, and an
ability to run CGI scripts, which is not always the case.

<TD>I set up WebSTUMP for you.

<H2>A Note On Reliability</H2>

A newsgroup moderator provides a service to thousands of users. That
means that an interruption of his or her access to the moderation bot
is also an interruption of enjoyable activity for all of these
users. Ultimately, reliability of a STUMP installation is determined by
three things:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Reliability of the hosting computer and its internet provider
       and its internet connection.
  <LI> Inherent reliability (or lack thereof) of the STUMP program.
  <LI> Expertise of the person who is running it
</UL>

After many years of commercial software development and in particular
writing reliable software at work, I have realized that truly reliable
computing (with rate of outages less than 0.01%) is either
prohibitively expensive, or plain impossible. Even systems that are
created with the foremost objective of achieving highest fault
tolerance, such as AT&T telephone switching system or their frame relay
system, have been embarrassed by lengthy outages. Be assured that it
happened not because AT&T lied to its customers about its intentions or
did mot make a good faith effort. Rather, it happened because it was
bound to happen. A mistake was only in making impossible claims.<P>

I do not believe that truly high reliability is achievable on modern
Internet. Also, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, which
means that there is no point in trying to completely crash-proof one
piece of a system without achieving similar quality levels in other
pieces.<P>

However, I do make an effort to make STUMP as reliable as reasonably
possible. I also guarantee to the ReadySTUMP users that I will apply a
good effort to make their STUMP installations reliable. I also do
regular backups and implement failover schemes. Note, however, that
switching to a secondary site can take a day or even more. I do have
contingency plans for such outages, however.<P>

The computer that hosts ReadySTUMP is as reliable as most Internet
providers, and is directly connected to the internet via a LAN and a
high speed link.<P>

My personal experience running STUMP installations is that once set
up, they rarely malfunction. This has not been the case from the
beginning, and I was enormously helped by the experiences of dozens of
moderators running STUMP.<P>

Our goal is to be <B>more</B> reliable than an average STUMP installation
running on an average internet provider. I have the capability and
commitment to achieve that. I shall also ensure that general system issues,
such as disk space overflows and so on do not impact the running moderation
sites.<P>

<H2>A Note on Newsgroup Addresses</H2>

Many moderators are concerned that their newsgroup moderation
addresses remain stable over long periods of time, even if they change
internet providers. Here, I guarantee that even if you decide to
discontinue your service, we'll keep your address functional for a
long, but limited in the absense of fees, period of time.<P>

<h2>Prices</H2>

My philosophy is that it is better to offer a good service
to a few willing people at the fair price, and keep them happy, rather
than give a poor service at a cheap price to a lot of unhappy people
and use my time unwisely.<P>

The prices are:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Class A: $50 set-up and $35/mo, payable monthly
  <LI>Class B: $0 set-up and $30 per month, payable for a year in advance.
</UL>

Note that class B users are guaranteed that mail sent to their accounts
at our site shall be forwarded to their new site in case if they decide
to discontinue their service, at no charge.<P>

For class A users, the fee for forwarding mail shall not exceed $3/mo.<P>

I guarantee that your requests to make changes and investigate problems
will be resolved promptly.<P>

I guarantee timely updates of your moderation software and will
listen to all suggestions for improvement.<P>

<H2>Summary</H2>

I am not just an Internet provider that also happens to host several
moderation accounts. I specialize in hosting moderators, know what
they need, listen to them, and have the ability to deliver.
<code>Stump.Algebra.Com</CODE> hosted, and still hosts without
glitches, the first ever installation of STUMP.<P>
