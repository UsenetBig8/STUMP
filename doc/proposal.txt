An example of a _FICTIONAL_, but good, proposal, for an alt.* newsgroup. 
Short, complete, and easy.

From: Mary@alabama.net (Mary Smith)
Subject: PROPOSAL: alt.support.boredom.moderated moderated
Organization: Igloo in North Eskimo
Newsgroups: alt.config,alt.support.boredom,alt.life.sucks



INTRODUCTION:

According to the analysis of the DejaNews archive of alt.support.boredom,
in the past year, alt.support.boredom had around 11,000 submissions. Of
those, however, only about 40% (our estimate) were genuinely on topic
of asb, and the rest were mostly crossposted trolls and flames, as well
as pervasive sex spam.

The community of alt.support.boredom readers feels that there is a need
for a parallel, moderated newsgroup existing to support sufferers from
boredom and help their recovery.

ASBM will provide a well-controlled newsgroup for worldwide discussions
about boredom through robomoderation. The main purpose of robomoderation
will be to weed out spam and trolls. Even though moderators do have
an option of moderating posters by hand, we shall attempt to let most
postings from regular participants to bypass human moderation and
associated delays by means of automatic approvals.

Those believing in anarchy can stay in the unmoderated group
alt.support.boredom, which is not going to be removed under any
circumstances.

CHARTER:

This group is for supporting individuals suffering from (or enjoying)
boredom.  Discussions of what to do, how to spice up one's life, as
well as more minute details of lives of boredom survivors are welcome
here. Messages that are not discussing boredom exactly, but contribute
to community building, are also allowed.

Heated discussions, to the extent that they help relieve boredom, are
also allowed, however moderators shall try to use their best judgment
to not let them grow into life threatening scandals.

Moderators shall use a combination of robotic and human moderation
in order to maintain ASBM. The main purpose of robomoderation is to
speed up discussions by regulars, as well as to bring the load on human
moderators down.

Crossposting, binary postings and commercial solititations other than
occasional forsale ads by ASBM participants, are not allowed. Advertising
of sexual websites is strictly forbidden.

Moderators may employ advanced filtering techniques to weed out spam and
prevent attacks disrtupting the newsgroup.

Messages that contain excessive HTML tags are not allowed, however as the
Internet technology evolves, this requirement can be relaxed or changed.

All rejected messages will be returned to posters with an explanation
of the reason for rejection. Note that, due to technical limitations on
the ability of moderation software, posters without replyable addresses
will not be able to receive rejection notices.

While posts from anonymous or despammed addresses (such as
mary@alabama.NOSPAM.net) are allowed, forgery (posting messages purporting
to be from a person other than the actual poster) is forbidden.

By posting to or reading ASBM, you agree to indemnify and hold
moderators harmless from any damages related to your participation in
ASBM. Moderators do not always agree with the articles that they approve.

MODERATORS:

This newsgroup will be moderated by a team of moderators. Initially
the moderators are:
