The following steps were used to add comp.ai to our existing STUMP/WEBSTUMP installation. We would appreciate any feedback to these steps!

Steps I followed:

Set up a new STUMP installation in its own directory (henceforth referred to as $STUMP_HOME). I started by copying one of the existing STUMP directory hierarchies (~/stump-nam/) to a new one. I am not sure whether this was a good idea, or whether starting from a clean installation would have been easier.
Add the newsgroup you will be moderating to WebSTUMP via the web interface.
Create email aliases for the group (through https://config.panix.com).
groupname@ for submissions
groupname-request@ for contacting the moderator(s)
groupname-noack@ (no-ack submissions address, which for our groups seem to be set up to receive all submissions)
groupname-approved@ for handling approved (and to-be-approved) messages
groupname-approval-key@ for requesting the PGP public signing key for the group
Edit ~/.procmailrc to add a new set of recipes for handling messages to these aliases, using the existing ones for other groups as a template. There is also some example code in $STUMP_HOME/etc/procmailrc.
Edit notification scripts to add code for the new group and add the moderator addresses:
~/scripts/notify_moderators
~/scripts/check_webstump_queue
Generate a PGP key pair for signing articles. Export an ASCII-armored version of the public key and put it in $STUMP_HOME/approval_key.txt and $STUMP_HOME/etc/approval_key.txt (not sure if both files are used, but both exist; might be easiest to make one a link to the other).
Edit files in the new STUMP installation:
$STUMP_HOME/etc/procmail/*
$STUMP_HOME/bin/send_pgp_key (update email address in message body)
$STUMP_HOME/bin/updateActionCount (update email address in message body) (is this used?)
$STUMP_HOME/data/noack.list (update email addresses, add/remove any as required)
$STUMP_HOME/etc/added-headers (ensure URLs and other info all looks OK)
$STUMP_HOME/etc/messages/* (update charter URL, mod address, and any other info)
$STUMP_HOME/etc/modack.approved (update charter URL)
$STUMP_HOME/etc/modack.received (update charter URL)
$STUMP_HOME/etc/modenv (main config/environment file)
Test submissions directly mailed to the submission address: do they arrive in WebSTUMP, do notifications work, can they be rejected?
Add cron jobs:
$HOME/stump/etc/modenv $HOME/scripts/check_webstump_queue [groupname]
$HOME/scripts/pgpmoose -g [groupname] > /dev/null (if you want to use PGPMoose)
Contact the ISC and ask them to change the moderator address over to the new submission address.
