Here are some frequently asked questions (and answers) for those who
want to create a moderated picture newsgroup.<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Why is this software limited to <A HREF=hosting>ReadySTUMP</A> users?</B><BR>
      A: Just like the reast of STUMP software, the picture moderation
         program will be released publicly. I plan on releasing it at 
         some point later in the future, when I make it easier to install.
         This program is very complex logically (processing uuencoded
         and MIME-encoded messages is not trivial) and therefore requires
         a tricky installation.<br>
	 There is not much point in releasing a working 
         program that is too hard to install.
  <LI><B>I want to moderate an erotica newsgroup. What can you say about it?</B><BR>
      A: I have no problems with this. (except for child porn, see below).
  <LI><B>Do you need to know my name, address, and so on?</B><BR>
      A: Not really. As long as you pay and are reachable by email,
         that's fine with me.
  <LI><B>How about child porn newsgroups?</B><BR>
      A: I do not wish to carry them. I believe that
         the First Amendment of the United States Constitution does
         permit posting child porn. However, the realities of this
         society make serving these groups impracticable and this is
         just not the battle that I am willing to wage.
