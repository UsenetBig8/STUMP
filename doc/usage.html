<A NAME=help><H1>Where to get HELP</H1></A>

First of all, please take your time and be prepared to be patient.
Since configurations of local systems and newsgroups are different,
setting them up takes some time.

There are two ways you can get help. The first one is free, the second
is not.

If you know something about Unix, you probably can try to go the first
route.  If you are not a Unix person, second route may be the way to go.

<UL>
  <LI> STUMP-users mailing list.<P>

     There is a mailing list for STUMP users. You can subsrcibe and ask your
     questions there. They will likely be answered within a day or two.
     To subscribe, send email to majordomo @ algebra.com and say in the
     message-body "subscribe stump-users".<P>

     I do monitor that list and help you get your questions answered. The
     submission address for sending messages is stump-users @ algebra.com.

  <LI> Commercial installation services.<P>

     For non-Unix people, I perform a service whereby I install STUMP
     on their system. I also provide them with a five month warranty,
     which means that if something breaks, I will be there to help.<P>

     <B>Note, however</B>, that I encourage you to take the free route
     and do it by yourself, and am not trying to make a sale. Installing
     STUMP is almost always a useful experience.
</UL>

<A NAME=init><H1>Initial Setup</H1></A>

The steps outlined in this chapter should be done only once, when you
start setting up the robomoderator. Suppose that you, <I>John Doe
&lt johndoe@yoursite.com&gt</I> are the supporter of the newly created
group <A HREF=news:comp.sys.foobars.moderated>
comp.sys.foobars.moderated </A>, and your users like to refer to your
group as <B>csfm</B>.<P>

<H2> Setting up a separate Unix account. <B>[SYSADMIN]</B> </H2>

You need a separate user ID to run your robomoderator program. There are two
compelling reasons for that. First of all, submissions to your newsgroup 
will arrive to the moderation address by email. It is very easy to confuse 
submissions and personal emails. Imagine how disappointed would be your
private correspondents if you mistakenly post their private emails!<P>

Second, and more important, reason for having a separate account for 
personal work and robomoderator is security. Internet is a wild and 
dangerous place full of people willing to inflict serious harm on others
just for the sheer fun of it. I have proofread and verified all moderation
scripts for security, and built extensive protection against malicious
attacks aiming to hack robomoderation account. However, I cannot give
you a 100% assurance that robomoderation process is secure.<P>

If you operate robomoderator from your private account and someone manages to
hack it, all your private files will be open for prying eyes of people whom
you do not even know. If it happens in an isolated account, the damage will 
be much more limited.<P>

All in all though, you can get along with just using your Unix account.</P>

<B>Note:</B> If you do not want to deal with setting up a Unix account,
I offer a complete moderation site hosting service called <A HREF=hosting>
ReadySTUMP</A>.<P>

If you do not have superuser privileges, you cannot set up a legitimate
account. Please ask your system administrator to do it for you. A good
name for such account would be comprised of first letters of your
newsgroup name. For example, account for soc.culture.russian.moderated
is called <CODE>scrm@algebra.com</CODE> (I am the sysadmin of algebra.com).<P>

You may call the robomod's account <CODE>csfm@yoursite.com</CODE>.

<H2> Setting up sendmail aliases. <B>[SYSADMIN]</B></H2>

Remember that robomoderator performs several functions: <P>

<UL>
  <LI> Accepts and checks incoming submissions
  <LI> Accepts approvals and rejections by human moderators
  <LI> Maintains moderators' private mailing list
  <LI> Forwards complaints of posters to all human moderators
</UL>

For each such purpose, a separate email address must be established. Note
the distinction between an email address and a user id: several email
addresses may correspond to one user ID. These addresses should normally be
<I>sendmail aliases</I>. These aliases are [normally] defined in file 
<CODE>/etc/aliases</CODE>. You should ask your systems adminiastrator 
to establish these aliases for your group. Below is the example of the 
part of aliases file for Comp.Sys.FooBars.Moderated. <P>

<LISTING>

###################################################################### CSFM
# Comp.Sys.FooBars.Moderated Aliases #
######################################
#
# submissions
csfm-submit:  csfm

# To me, technical problems
csfm-admin:	johndoe

# Moderators' list
csfm-mods:	csfm

# Non-technical complaints, same as "board" above
csfm-board:	csfm-mods

# Mail errors, go to hell
csfm-errors:	/dev/null

# Approved and rejected messages
csfm-approved:	csfm

# Approval key autoreply Bot
csfm-approval-key: csfm

# for posters who do not want autoacknowledgments:
csfm-noack: csfm

# alternative names, for absent-minded posters
comp-sys-foobars-moderated: csfm-submit
comp.sys.foobars.moderated: csfm-submit

</LISTING>

As you can easily see, messages to all of these addresses go to the 
robomoderator's address.<P>

Note also, that if you have only one address and a sendmail-based
system, and a non-cooperative sysadmin, you can try to get around
the requirement to have several sendmail aliases. If addresses like
yourname+comment@yoursite.com work, then you can use addresses like
"csfm+approved@yoursite.com" instead.  Make sure that they do in fact
work (it is not guaranteed) and then edit your stump/etc/procmailrc
accordingly.<P>


<H2> Setting up procmail </H2>

You should set up <B>procmail</B> - an excellent, free third-party tool 
for flexible processing of incoming email messages. It works on any Unix.
You can download it from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail">
   ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail
</A>. Also, you can follow 
<A HREF="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/"> this link </A>
for an excellent introduction (and more!) to procmail.<P>

Procmail binary is provided for Linux and FreeBSD, see the main STUMP
page for the reference.<P>

Look at the <A HREF=procmailrc.txt>sample .procmailrc file</A> that is
used by soc.culture.russian.moderated.<P>

<H2> Setting up PGP </H2>

NOTE: Not all moderators need to set up PGP. You only need PGP
if you plan to use PGP Moose for authentication of approvals.
Skip the rest of this section if you are not interested. You can 
always return to it later. Make sure that the settings in the
<A HREF=modenv.txt>stump/etc/modenv</A> file are correct. If
you plan to NOT use PGP, keep PGP set to "none" in the "stump/etc/modenv"
file.<P>

Set up and familiarize yourself with PGP, an excellent 
third-party encryption and authentification program. <P>

Download it from <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html">this
link</A>. If you are not residing in the US or cannot download PGP
from that page, try <A HREF="ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks">
this link</A> and try to find PGP there.<P>

Another link (in Norway) is this: <A HREF="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/">
download PGP from Net sites outside</A>.<P>

PGP binary is provided for Linux and FreeBSD, see the main STUMP
page for the reference.<P>


<H2> Setting up Perl </H2>

Most likely you already have a perl interpreter. Simply type at your 
unix command prompt: <P>

<LISTING>
  $ perl -v
</LISTING>

If you see some meaningful output, you are fine and you have perl.
Otherwise you need to install it. Try <A HREF="http://perl.com">this
link</A> and follow instructions. Installing perl may be quite an effort,
but good chances are that you do not need to do it.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME=start><H1>Starting with Robomoderator</H1></A>

<H2> Unpacking Source</H2>

Got to the home directory of your robomoderation account. Put there
the <CODE>stump-....tar.gz</CODE> file that you just downloaded. Do this
command: <P>

<LISTING>
$ whoami
csfm
$ cd $HOME
$ zcat stump_2_3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</LISTING>

This command will produce a lot of files under the <CODE> $HOME/stump</CODE>
subdirectory. <P>

<H2> Creating <B>..../etc</B> directory </H2>

In the distribution that you receive, under <CODE> $HOME/stump</CODE>,
there is directory <CODE>$HOME/stump/etc.dist</CODE>. It should be
<B>renamed</B> to <CODE> $HOME/stump/etc</CODE>, and you should do the
same with bin.dist, tmp.dist and data.dist directories. etc contains
files that you need to customize. The reason for such renaming is that
when you receive upgrades of the robomod, the upgrade does not override
the files that you customized.<P>

Go through files in etc directory, and edit them carefully.<P> Most of
them are self explanatory. I put lots of comments in them. You should
begin with editing the <A HREF=modenv.txt> stump/etc/modenv</A> file.<P>

Create a symbolic links for procmail: <P>

<LISTING>
  $ /bin/ln -s $HOME/stump/etc/procmailrc $HOME/.procmailrc
  mkdir $HOME/Mail      # Creates directory for mail
  chmod 700 $HOME.Mail  # Make it safe
</LISTING>

Edit your <A HREF=procmailrc.txt>$HOME/stump/procmailrc</A> to tailor it
to the needs of your newsgroup. Do it carefully.<P>

<B>IMPORTANT:</B> Later you MUST make sure that procmail processes all
your incoming mail correctly and that all rules are written right. For
logs of all procmail activity you may look into $HOME/Mail/from logfile.
You can set <CODE>VERBOSE=ON</CODE> in the <code>procmailrc</code> 
file if you want to see detailed output.<P>

NOTE: file Mail/from is an excellent source of debugging information.<P>

<H2> Editing Data Files in <B>..../data</B> </H2>

Rename <CODE>data.dist</CODE> to <CODE>data</CODE>.<P>

You can (and should) edit some of the files in the data directory.
These files are good.guys.list, bad.guys.list, bad.words.list. They
contain Perl's regular expressions for detecting messages from preapproved 
and blacklisted posters, and suspicious words, respectively.<P>

Edit them and leave them blank (no spaces).<P>

<H2> Setting .profile for robomod support </H2>

It is <B>very important</B> that you source <CODE>modenv</CODE> file
from the etc directory in your .profile (or .login) file. You need to
have several environment variables, including PATH, to be set correctly
in order to support robomod properly.<P>

Put this in your .profile or .login file: 

<LISTING> 
source $HOME/stump/etc/modenv
</LISTING>

<H2>Creating ONE PAIR of PGP keys.</H2>

[Skip this part if you do not plan on using PGP Moose]. <P>

According to <A HREF="spec.html">the specification</A> of the robomod,
you have to have one PGP key -  for signing approved articles with PGP
Moose application.<P>

Pick a passphrase that is not too hard to type and remember. Usage of
these PGP keys is not a very high-security application, so you can
select 512-bit key sizes. Save this passphrase in file
<CODE>$HOME/.pgp-passphrase</CODE><P>. Make sure that this passphrase is
not readable by anyone except the robomod user.<P>

Name the key by analogy with the key used for SCRM (see modenv file
and user names there). Your PGP Key must be named like this:<P>

<PRE>
pub   512/ABB554F5 1996/02/26 CSFM Approval Key &lt;csfm-approval-key@yoursite.com&gt;
</PRE><P>

PGP Keys are generated using command

<LISTING>
    pgp -kg -u "CSFM Approval Key &lt;csfm-approval-key@yoursite.com&gt"
</LISTING>

</TABLE>

Copy your keyring to a specially designated place for STUMP:

<LISTING>
  cp $HOME/.pgp/pubring.pgp $HOME/stump/data/pubring.pgp
</LISTING>

<P>

<H2> Compiling C programs in <B>stump/c</B> directory</H2>

Go to the c directory and type ./compile. That should do it. If it does
not, figure out on your own. The programs are extremely simple. Perhaps
you can change the setting of CC to gcc, especially if you use Sun
computers.<P>

<H2>Creating List for reasons of Rejection and Rejection Messages</H2>

You should think what broad categories for reasons of rejection you
will have in your group. Give them simple names. Edit file
<CODE>etc/reject</CODE> and edit part that consists of calls to
subroutine <CODE>addReason</CODE>. Customize it to your taste. After
that, go to directory <CODE>etc/messages</CODE> and make sure that
files there have exactly the names that you listed as first parameters
in calls to <CODE>addReason</CODE>. Make sure they have comprehensive
and polite messages corresponding to the broad reasons for rejection
that you made up.<P>

These messages will be sent to users when their articles are rejected
for specified reasons. The messages that I supplied are not bad.</P>

Make sure that you keep the following files:
<UL>
  <LI>abuse -- to send back when rejecting banned users
  <LI>crosspost -- to send back when rejecting for megacrossposting
  <LI>charter -- to send back when rejecting for violating
      requirements of the charter that are checked automatically
  <LI>signature -- to send back when rejecting for bogus PGP signature.
</UL>

Edit file <CODE>rejection-reasons.lst</CODE> and put there the
reasons that your moderators are allowed to choose for rejections.
They should have names corresponding to the filenames in etc/messages,
separated from comments by double colon ::.<P>

Example:<P>

<PRE>
offtopic::Message is grossly off topic (spam, turks, etc)
charter::Technical violation of charter (binary, exc. quoting)
harassing::Message of harassing/insulting/hatemongering content
</PRE>

<HR>
<H1> <A NAME=test>Testing Your Setup</A> </H1>

First of all, your default setup uses my free WebSTUMP service,
so that you have a Web based interface for moderation. This means
that you install and host STUMP, and you use my installation of WebSTUMP
to moderate articles. WebSTUMP is a web based moderation tool, which
is nice but a pain to set up. (it requires running setuid code and
cgi-bin capability).<P>

To test your newsgroup, first write to <CODE><B>ichudov @ algebra . com
</B></CODE>, and ask me to create a newsgroup account for you in
webstump. Please tell me your newsgroup name and the approved address
(such as csfm-approved@your.site.com). Free WebSTUMP is located at<P>

<A HREF=http://freewebstump.algebra.com/stump-cgi/webstump.cgi>
	http://freewebstump.algebra.com/stump-cgi/webstump.cgi
</A><P>


You should test your setup of the robomoderator very extensively. If
the robomod fails when your group goes to production, you will be
ashamed. When you are testing, look at file $HOME/Mail/from, which 
contains all standard error output of your programs. Try to send 
submissions by email to your moderation address. Do<P>

<LISTING>
    tail -f $HOME/Mail/from
</LISTING>

to see what's going on.

<H2> Choosing a "victim" group </H2>

I suggest that you use <CODE>misc.jobs.misc</CODE> for your testing.
It is a dead newsgroup infested by spamsters. Nobody will bother 
and complain about your postings.<P>

Edit file <CODE>etc/modenv</CODE> and put
<CODE>misc.jobs.misc</CODE> in the assignment to NEWSGROUP, for
testing purposes.<P>

<H2> Things to Test </H2>

Test at least these conditions: 

<TABLE border compact>
<CAPTION align=top> Testing Schedule </CAPTION>

<TH> Test Case <TH> Test Goal <TR>
<TD> Moderators' list <TD> Moderators receive all message submitted to
