If you plan on using @uref{hosting,ReadySTUMP hosting service} and want
to propose a newsgroup (both in alt.* and Big Eight), contact me
(@uref{mailto:ichudov@@algebra.com,ichudov@@algebra.com}) before
submitting a proposal. This can save you from submitting erroneous
proposals and making easily fixable mistakes. The purpose of this is not
to influence your moderation policy, but to make sure that
ReadySTUMP-related technical aspects are spelled out properly. Your
policy is your business.

If you plan on using @uref{index.html,my moderation bot STUMP} and host
it by yourselves on your own Unix machine, please review sample charters
below and feel free to join the stump-users mailing list. To subscribe,
send email to majordomo@@algebra.com, saying "subscribe" in the body of
the message

This is a list to help STUMP users maintain their moderation bots and
cope with problems.

@node Charters
@section Charters
@anchor{#charters}
First of all, every moderated newsgroup needs a Charter. A Charter is
like a constitution of a newsgroup. It spells out rules such as which
articles are accepted and which are unacceptable, how moderators are
replaced, and so on. All people in the newsgroup should abide by the
charter. Charters do not have to be anything too fancy. Charters for alt
newsgroups are generally simplier than charters for groups that go
through a voting process. Feel free to use these examples of newsgroup
charters to write your own.

@node Technical Aspects of Creating alt* Newsgroups
@section Technical Aspects of Creating alt.* Newsgroups
@anchor{#technical-aspects-of-creating-alt.-newsgroups}
@strong{If you want to use my ReadySTUMP hosting service for a moderated
alt.* newsgroup:} Generally, new moderators, regardless of which
moderation service they want to use, have to to the following:

@itemize
@item
Contact David Lawrence from isc.org, requesting to create a forwarding
address for their newsgroups.
@item
Issue a specially formatted newgroup control message, by injecting it
into a USENET newsserver. Typically this is done manually and requires
knowledge of NNTP protocol. This is not rocket science, however it is a
technical task and requires good understanding of how USENET works.
Instructions on how to do it are available in alt.config. See
@uref{http://www.gweep.bc.ca/~edmonds/usenet/good-newgroup.html,this
instruction manual} to see if you want to do it by yourself.
@end itemize

To save moderators from a hassle of doing these tasks by themselves,
@strong{I can create the newsgroup and request forwarding at no charge}.
It is included in the ReadySTUMP service.

@node Criticism of Your Proposal
@section Criticism of Your Proposal
@anchor{#criticism-of-your-proposal}
When you propose an alt newsgroup, you have to post the proposal to
alt.config for "review" by interested people. Expect to see criticism
and suggestions. Remember that all criticism is only good for you, as it
can help you avoid some major mistakes or misnaming your newsgroup.
Ultimately, no amount of criticism can prevent you from creating any
alt.* newsgroup you wish. Being friendly generally tends to attract good
advice.

When you propose a Big Eight newsgroup (a soc.* or a sci.* or a rec.*,
etc) newsgroup, remember that your proposal will have to pass through a
lengthy discussion and voting process. You have to expect that a few
people will make quite caustic comments about your proposal. Depending
on your personality, this may or may not be pleasant, but it is to be
expected. Consider this process a test of your determination to be a
moderator. After all, moderators must be patient people to be effective,
and the RFD/CFV process is one of the best tests of patience.

@node Rmgroups
@section Rmgroups
@anchor{#rmgroups}
Rmgroup is a technical term, an abbreviation of "remove group". In the
original USENET design, RMGROUPS were used to delete badly configured
newsgroups. Due to widespread abuse and lack of built in authentication,
Rmgroup messages are no longer effective and are widely ignored by all
but most misconfigured news sites.

In the @code{alt.*} hierarchy, anyone can issue a rmgroup message, just
as anyone can create a newsgroup.

There are a few self-approinted guardians of propriety, who watch all
newsgroup messages and rmgroup those newly created newsgroups that they
do not like. But, just as masturbation has not made anyone pregnant,
rmgroup messages do not really have an effect on all newsgroups. If you
see a rmgroup message that deletes your newsgroup, simply ignore it.
