WebSTUMP is a user interface for STUMP users. It gives moderators an
easy and universally accessible Web interface through which they can
moderate newsgroups. Use of WebSTUMP requires NO computer skills beyond
knowing how to operate a Web browser.<P>

The demo pages give you an opportunity to "test drive" STUMP. They
are not functional in the sense that your actions do not affect anyone.
However, they do give you a "look and feel" of how WebSTUMP interface
looks to moderators.<P>

When you click on "Begin test Drive!", you will be taken to the
live installation of WebSTUMP, where you can see how it works for
yourself. When you get there, read the front page and then click on
"demo.newsgroup". demo.newsgroup is a special newsgroup where your
actions would seem real, but with no effect on anything. So click away
there.<P>

You will be asked for a login and password. First, log in as user
"test", password "test". Try out the interface for human moderators. 
Make sure that you see how picture moderation works.<P>

After that, return to the main WebSTUMP page (hit the "return here for
WebSTUMP"), and log in as user "admin", password "test". This will let you
see how you can administer your newsgroup. Try adding new users, and
edit some of the configuration files like the list of good posters.<P>

This window will stay with you throughout the process.<P>
