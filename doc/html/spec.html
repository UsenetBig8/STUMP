<A NAME="requirements"><H1>1. Requirements to the Robomoderator</H1></A>

Requirements to the moderation process originate from two sources: the
proposed Charter, and from our past experiences with forgeries,
mailbombings, and other no less interesting things. We tried to take
into account habits and weaknesses of the future users and posters.<P>

<H2>1.1. Requirements of the Charter</H2>

<H3>1.1.1. Enforcement of Style</H3>

All articles longer than 25 lines should not contain more than 2/3 of
quoted text. All articles longer than 25 lines cannot have more than
75 characters per line on average. <P>

<H3>1.1.2. Posting Policy</H3>

Robomoderator should be able to support so called "white list" and
"black list" of posters. All messages submitted by members of the
white list get approved and posted immediately (see <A
HREF="#signing">Signing Approved Messages).</A> However, presense of
certain text patterns in the body of messages from posters from "white
list" may trigger sending the article to human moderators for
approval.<P>

All messages submitted by members of the "black list" are
rejected. However, no person shall be in the black list for period
exceeding one month.<P>

Messages from all oter persons get forwarded to human moderators for
approval.<P> 

<H3>1.1.3. Authentification and Protection from Forgeries</H3>

Robomoderator must be able to decide whether a certain poster is
required to submit PGP signed articles, and if the answer is yes,
reject all messages that are not signed properly. Robomoderator should
be able to work in "protected" mode, when all posters from the white
list are required to sign their submissions with PGP, and provide
robomoderator with their public PGP keys.<P>

<H3>1.1.4. Openness of the Moderation Process</H3>

All users whose messages have been rejected must receive a clear
explanation of reasons for rejection. Moderators must establish an
address for appeals that will reach all moderators. All rejected
submissions must be placed on a designated WWW page for public
scrutiny.<P>

<H2>1.1.5. Nature of Users</H2>

A big part of our users has little experience with computers and have
not been exposed to the issues of computer security. They may have
little experience in using encryption products such as PGP. At the
same time, they may be valuable contributors to the newsgroup and
should not be discouraged from posting by excessive requirements to
their methods of posting. <P>

Many of the users (frequently users of freenets) simply have no way of
installing and using PGP. Many companies discourage their employees
from using PGP at work.<P>

<H2>1.2. Security</H2>

At the same time, many other posters and participants find pleasure in
hooliganism, forging other people's posts, mailbombing, attempts to
hack computers of their flamewar enemies and so on. We shall,
therefore, reasonably expect such attempts to continue. We shall take
adequate steps in protecting posters and robomoderation process from
malicious attempts to disrupt process of moderation and forge messages
under other people's names.<P>

We shall make an attempt to prevent as many attacks on the
moderation protocol as possible.<P>

<H3>1.2.1. Anonymous and Pseudonymous Posting</H3>

Unfortunately, there have been cases when some mentally unstable users
harassed other users, for example by faxing silly complaints to human
resources departments of their employers, posting phone number of
their bosses and by other equally creative methods. <P>

This alone justifies a need for allowing users to post pseudonymously.
These users may use anonymous remailers to deliver their messages to
the submission address. At the same time, they may want to have a
permanent identity, that is, correct belief of others that a series of
posts has been written by one person or a group of persons. As well,
we may request these users to PGP-sign their submissions.<P>

<H3>1.2.2. Protection from Forgeries</H3>

We shall protect out moderated newsgroup against forgeries, that is,
unapproved postings with fake "Approved: " field. For this task,
robomoderator shall sign all approved messages with its private key,
and all other users must be able to verify these signatures using the
public key of the robomoderator.<P>

All articles not bearing a valid signature by robomoderator must be
destroyed.<P> 

<A NAME="incoming"><H1>2. Processing of Incoming Messages</H1>
</A>

<H2>2.1. Mail Processing</H2>

Note that the robomoderator communicates with the outside world
through email. Submissions, approval/rejection messages and
complaints arrive by mail.<P>

All incoming mail, including submissions, appeals, messages approved
and rejected by human moderators, requests for public key for
approving articles, and so on, are redirected to <B>procmail</B>
utility. Procmail script filters out all mail bombs. After that,
messages get processed according to their destination address.<P>

Types of incoming messages include: <P>

<OL>
<LI> Submissions intended for posting
<LI> Approval messages by human moderators
<LI> Rejection messages by human moderators
<LI> Appeals to the moderator board
<LI> Requests for public key used for approvals
</OL>

Each of the types has its own mail alias.

<H2>2.2. Processing of Incoming Submissions.</H2>

Incoming submissions may be encrypted with robomod's public key. We
urge our users to use this encryption.

<H3>2.2.1. Checking PGP Signatures</H3>

If an incoming message has a PGP signature, it is verified against
database of known PGP Public keys. If the verification fails by any
reason, the message is rejected and a rejection note is sent to the
sender.<P>

Note that users' message may contain so called header block inside
the signed portion of their submissions. This may protect users from
replay attacks when their messages are intercepted and then
crossposted to zillions of newsgroup with some offensive subject. The
following header fields in the header block will override header
fields supplied in the envelope of incoming emails:<P>

<UL>
<LI> <B><CODE>Reply-To:</CODE></B>
<LI> <B><CODE>Subject:</CODE> </B>
<LI> <B><CODE>Newsgroups:</CODE> </B>
</UL>


If the signature matches, the address header fields are rewritten in
the following way: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Address set in the <B><CODE>From:</CODE></B> field is stored in
<B><CODE>X-Origin</CODE></B> field.

<LI> <B><CODE>From:</CODE></B> field is set to the main user id in the PGP key

<LI> <B><CODE>Reply-To:</CODE></B> field is set to [possibly
overriden in the header block] <B><CODE>Reply-To:</CODE></B>. If it
is not present, it is set to the address in the
<B><CODE>From:</CODE></B> field.

</UL>

<H3>2.2.2. Rules Requiring Presence of PGP signatures</H3>

The following conditions cause rejection of unsigned messages: <P>

<OL>
<LI> The poster is in the database of people required to sign their
submissions;
<LI> The poster is in the "white list" (that normally causes automatic
approval) and a flag requiring all posters from white list to sign
their messages is set to YES.
</OL>

<H3>2.2.3. Removal of PGP Signatures</H3>

If user's submission is signed (and signature is valid), but contains
no header block, PGP signature is removed. A standard header field

<LISTING>
	X-Auth-Info: valid PGP signature from &lt;username&gt; was detected
	             and removed
</LISTING>

If header block is present, PGP signature is not removed. We do it for
the purpose of protecting our users from replay attacks outlined
above.<P>

<H2>2.3. Approval messages by human moderators</H2>

For details on exchange between robomod and human moderators, see 
separate chapter <A HREF="#humans">Exchange with Human
Moderators</A>.<P>

Messages coming to approved address are decrypted with a special
traffic key. Their integrity is verified, in particular robomod
checks the following:<P>

<OL>
<LI> That moderator attached word <B><CODE>APPROVE</B></CODE> to the 
bottom of the approval message.

<LI> That moderator's address attached to the article matches
moderator's address specified  in the article sent for moderation. It
helps us prevent attacks when someone wanting to get his/her message
approved intercepts it on the way to human moderators and sends it to
every human moderator, in the hope that it will boost the chances of
message to be posted.<P>

As per our scheme, only the original human moderator addressee can
produce a valid approval.<P>

<LI> That the article bears a valid signature from our Traffic
key. This key is different from the key used for approvals. Private
part of the traffic key is known only to the robomoderator, and public
part is known to human moderators only.<P>

This ensures that moderators cannot approve articles that did not come
through the initial submission address.<P> 

</OL>

After that, the approved message gets signed with our approval key and
gets posted. See <A HREF="#signing">Signing Approved Messages</A>.<P>

<H2>2.4. Rejection Messages by Human Moderators</H2>

Rejection messages by human moderators are verified in the same
fashion as approvals, with the only exception that it required word
<B><CODE>REJECT</B></CODE> instead of <B><CODE>APPROVE</B></CODE>.
Rejection messages also carry a code of the reason of rejection. <P>

Based on this code, a rejection message and a full copy of the
original article is sent to the author of the submission.<P>

<H2>2.5. Appeals to the Moderator Board</H2>

These appeals are simply distributed to all moderators.

<H2>2.6. Requests for public key used for approvals</H2>

A text copy of the approval key is sent back as a reply.

<A NAME="#signing"><H1>Signing Approved Messages</H1></A>

All approved messages are signed using PMApp by Greg Rose from
Sterling Software, with the approval's private PGP key. Other users
will have the public key and will be able to verify approvals using
Greg Rose's <B>pmcheck</B> script.

<A NAME="#humans"><H1>3. Exchange with Human Moderators</H1>
</A>

<H2> 3.1. Internal Traffic Key </H2> 

Human moderators will exercise their best judgment in deciding whether
to approve or reject submissions. Since, at least theoretically, daily
number of articles received by human moderators may be high, it is
very desirable to avoid having human moderators sign each of their
decisions. If we required human moderators to sign every decision,
they would likely store their passphrases in an insecure way. <P>

Still, in our system there must be some secret that should be known in
order to be able successfully approve a message. Without this secret,
anyone could send fake "approved" messages to the robomoderator.<P>

To solve this problem, we introduce another PGP key, <B>Robomod's
Internal Traffic Key</B>. Its private component will be known only to
the robomoderator. Its public component will be known only to human
moderators. To ensure security, human moderators encrypt all approval
and rejection messages sent to robomoderator with that key.<P>

Note that our system uses another PGP key, which is called <B>
Approval Key </B> and is used for exchange with the outside world, in
particular for: <P>

<UL>
  <LI> Signing approved articles before posting;
  <LI> Signing rejection messages;
  <LI> Verification of approval by PGP Moose.
</UL>

<H2> 4.2. Protocol of Exchange between Robomod and Human Moderators </H2>

<H3> 4.2.1. Sending Submissions to Human Moderators </H3>

Before sending out a message to a human moderator, robomod takes the
following steps: <P>

<UL>

<LI> It adds a line 

<B><PRE>
     SENT_TO: &lt;moderator_address&gt;
</PRE></B>

to the bottom of the article.

<LI> It signs the article (including headers) using the Internal
Traffic Key. Note that this signature is not valid for final approval
of postings, because it uses a different PGP key.

<LI> It prepends each line of the whole signed article by string 
<B><CODE>"X_"</CODE></B>. 

<LI> It creates headers for email delivery to human moderators 
and adds a special header

<B><PRE>
     X-Moderate-For: &lt;newsgroup name&gt;
</PRE></B>

so that human moderators can filter the messages for moderation into
a special mailbox.

</UL>

<H3> 4.2.2. Processing by Human Moderators </H3>

Human moderators receive submissions by email. They review them
and decide whether to approve or reject them. If they approve a
message, they pipe it through a shell script called "approve". This
script simply adds a line

<B><PRE>
      APPROVE &lt;moderator&gt;
</PRE></B>

to the pre-signed article, encrypts it as a whole with robomod's
Internal Traffic Key, and sends to the special email address for
approved postings.<P>

Similar thing happens when moderators reject postings. They pipe the
article to a special script called 'reject'. It asks for a reson for
rejection, and then appends a line

<B><PRE>
       REJECT &lt;moderator&gt; &lt;reason&gt;
</PRE></B>

and then encrypts the whole message with robomod's Internal Traffic
Key. The encrypted message is sent to a special address for rejections.

<A NAME="monitoring"><H1>5. Detecting Forgeries</H1>
</A>

PGP Moose scripts will run on one or several machines to monitor the
newsgroup.  They will be reporting all unauthorized articles, and
possibly canceling them.  All messages coming into the robomoderator
and failing verification will be reported to the maintainer of the
robomoderator. <P>

At least in the beginning, automatic cancelling will be turned off.
Instead, all articles failing verification will be reported to
the robomod support person. <P>

</BODY>

<A NAME="todo"><H1>6. To Do List</H1></A>

<UL>
  <LI> Implement dup checking with Vulis's message digest prog. Maybe 
       I'll do it after getting 32 meg of memory and installing Postgres.
       Maybe postgres is not such a good idea if i want robomod to be 
       portable. need 2 think more.
  <LI> Proofread PMApp for security problems.
  <LI> Implement checks for excessive quoting and too long lines (PMApp
       also wraps lines! That's silly).
</UL>
