Picture Newsgroups
==================

\`\`Making Moderation Easy\'\'

\
Here are some frequently asked questions (and answers) for those who
want to create a moderated picture newsgroup.

-   **Why is this software limited to [ReadySTUMP](hosting) users?**\
    A: Just like the reast of STUMP software, the picture moderation
    program will be released publicly. I plan on releasing it at some
    point later in the future, when I make it easier to install. This
    program is very complex logically (processing uuencoded and
    MIME-encoded messages is not trivial) and therefore requires a
    tricky installation.\
    There is not much point in releasing a working program that is too
    hard to install.
-   **I want to moderate an erotica newsgroup. What can you say about
    it?**\
    A: I have no problems with this. (except for child porn, see below).
-   **Do you need to know my name, address, and so on?**\
    A: Not really. As long as you pay and are reachable by email,
    that\'s fine with me.
-   **How about child porn newsgroups?**\
    A: I do not wish to carry them. I believe that the First Amendment
    of the United States Constitution does permit posting child porn.
    However, the realities of this society make serving these groups
    impracticable and this is just not the battle that I am willing to
    wage.
