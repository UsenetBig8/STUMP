If You Want To Propose a Moderated Newsgroup
============================================

If you plan to propose a new group (either alt or Big 8) and are
considering using the STUMP robomoderator, please read this.

Note
----

If you plan to propose a new group in the Big 8 hierarchies, please 
feel free to contact the Big 8 Management Board at <board@big-8.org>.
We will be happy to help you write a good proposal and set up any 
moderation that is required. The purpose of this is not to influence 
your moderation policy, but to make sure that all the technical aspects 
are spelled out properly. Your policy is your business.

If you plan on using [STUMP](index.html) and hosting it yourself on
your own Unix machine, please feel free to join the stump-users mailing 
list. To subscribe, please visit the [list 
homepage](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/stump-users) and complete
the subscription form.

The STUMP-users list exists to help STUMP users maintain their moderation 
bots and cope with any problems that arise.

Charters
--------

First of all, every moderated newsgroup needs a Charter. A Charter is
like a constitution of a newsgroup. It spells out rules such as which
articles are accepted and which are unacceptable, how moderators are
replaced, and so on. All people in the newsgroup should abide by the
charter. Charters do not have to be anything too fancy. Charters for alt
newsgroups are generally simpler than charters for groups that go
through a voting process. Feel free to use these examples of newsgroup
charters to write your own.

Technical Aspects of Creating alt.\* Newsgroups
-----------------------------------------------

Generally, new moderators, regardless of which moderation platform they 
want to use, will need to do the following:

-   Contact David Lawrence from isc.org, requesting creation of a
    forwarding address for their newsgroups.
-   Issue a specially formatted newgroup control message, by injecting
    it into a USENET newsserver. Typically this is done manually and
    requires knowledge of the NNTP protocol. This is [not]{.underline}
    rocket science, however it is a technical task and requires good
    understanding of how USENET works. Instructions on how to do it are
    available in alt.config. See [this instruction
    manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20170314015852/http://www.gweep.ca/~edmonds/usenet/good-newgroup.html)
    if you want to do it yourself.

Criticism of Your Proposal
--------------------------

When you propose an alt newsgroup, you have to post the proposal to
alt.config for \"review\" by interested people. Expect to see criticism
and suggestions. Remember that all criticism is only good for you, as it
can help you avoid some major mistakes or misnaming your newsgroup.
Ultimately, no amount of criticism can prevent you from creating any
alt.\* newsgroup you wish. Being friendly generally tends to attract
good advice.

When you propose a Big Eight newsgroup (a soc.\* or a sci.\* or a
rec.\*, etc) newsgroup, remember that your proposal will have to pass
through a lengthy discussion process. You have to expect that
a few people will make quite caustic comments about your proposal.
Depending on your personality, this may or may not be pleasant, but it
is to be expected. Consider this process a test of your determination to
be a moderator. After all, moderators must be patient people to be
effective, and the RFD process is one of the best tests of patience.

Rmgroups
--------

Rmgroup is a technical term, an abbreviation of \"remove group\". In the
original USENET design, RMGROUPS were used to delete badly configured
newsgroups. Due to widespread abuse and lack of built in authentication,
rmgroup messages are no longer effective and are widely ignored by all
but most misconfigured news sites.

In the `alt.\*` hierarchy, anyone can issue a rmgroup message, just as
anyone can create a newsgroup.

There are a few self-approinted guardians of propriety, who watch all
newgroup messages and rmgroup those newly created newsgroups that they
do not like. But, as noted above, this will have no real effect. If you
see a rmgroup message that deletes your newsgroup, simply ignore it.
