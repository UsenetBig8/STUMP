<P>STUMP means <I>Secure Team-based Usenet Moderation Program</I>. STUMP is
currently working in production and is stable. The robomoderator code is
portable and configurable and is publicly available for moderator teams
on USENET <B>for free</B>. </P>

Even though STUMP is FREE, and there is a unrestricted mailing
list for STUMP support, we offer <B><A HREF=hosting/>commercial site
hosting</A></B>. It means that if you do not want to deal with Unix-based
stuff, we'll set it up for you on a centrally managed server. We
provide you with a service guarantee and give you an easy to use web
interface for moderation.  <BR><B>Click <A HREF=hosting/>here for more
information</A></B> </P>

<B>Moderation of <u>picture</u> newsgroups:</B> Users of ReadySTUMP can 
now moderate newsgroups with pictures. Articles with embedded pictures
(uuencoded or MIME) will be displayed properly (as graphical images) to
the moderators. That makes it possible to create moderated newsgroups
with pictures and moderate them easily. At the moment, I limited
this service to users of ReadySTUMP, for technical reasons. If
you are interested in creating a moderated picture newsgroup <a
href=pictures.html>click here</A>.<P>

There is a <A HREF=faq.txt>List of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</A>.

STUMP is more than just a program. It is also <B>my commitment</B> to
support and maintain it and its users in the best way possible. It is
also a community of existing users who can help you with their advice.
My goal is to keep STUMP the most flexible, easiest to use for human
moderators, and most full featured package available. I actively solicit
you to make your suggestions to improve STUMP, and welcome any and all
criticism.<P>

<H2> Basic features of the Robomoderator </H2>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> Can
  run on any Unix. Moderators can use Unix, Windows and Mac, and AOL,
  and generally can do their job as long as they are able to read email.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> 
   Web-based moderation (<A HREF=webstump.html> Test Drive It</A>)
   is also possible. It can be done by moderators even without knowledge
   of CGI or access to a CGI-enabled Web server -- 
   <A HREF=http://www.video-collage.com> a centrally managed
   server </A> is available as well as the ability to set up your own
   webservers if you want to.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> 
  Documentation is available in WWW form. (see 
  <A HREF="#instructions">Instructions</a> below)</P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> 
  User support available through stump-users mailing list.
  </P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> 
  Extremely versatile but easy configuration management.
  </P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Support for <B>group moderation</B> -- multiple human moderators, 
  which are randomly chosen for
  every incoming message that needs to be reviewed.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Automatic rejection of nonconforming messages, for example
       megacrossposts and encoded binaries are rejected automatically
       without human intervention.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Support of a preapproved list of posters whose posts are presumed to
       be good and do not need human review. It can help the moderator
       team to save their time and speed up posts by frequent posters.
       In practice, <B>about 80% of moderators' time can be saved with
       this feature.</B><P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Everything is archived. Achives may be presented as WWW Pages
  <A HREF=http://stump.algebra.com/~asar/approved/maillist.html>like this</A>.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Exchange between human moderators and robomod program is secured by
       PGP encryption and signatures. It prevents any "spoofing" of the
       robomoderator, when malicious users try to simulate fake
       moderators' approvals. This security is provided internally by
       perl scripts, and human moderators need not bother - everything
       is done for them.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top>
  Acknowledgments of receipt, rejection messages with explanations
       (standardized or supplied by human moderators) are sent back to
       posters.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> All
  approved articles are digitally signed by PMApp program by Greg Rose.
       It provides positive and reliable identification of forgeries and
       unapproved posts. A daemon program is provided that looks for all
       unauthorized posts and deletes them automatically.  <BR> Note
       that these signatures are placed in the header of the post and
       they do not clutter the actual text of the messages. These
       scripts also provide protectin from subtle impersonation attacks
       described by Dr. Vulis.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> Some
  posters may request additional protection from forgeries.<P>

  <IMG SRC=images/active/amenities/green-dot.gif ALIGN=top> 
  Support for a moderators'-only mailing list. This is nice for
  newsgroups that have more than one moderator.</P>

<H2>Typical Setups Supported</H2>

STUMP supports the following typical configurations of robomoderator 
programs:<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>"Technical":</B> Posts from all posters are approved
       automatically by default, but posts from a selected group of people
       are forwarded to human moderators for review. There are several
       "suspicious" words which also trigger forwarding an article to a
       human moderator for review.<P>

       This configuration is good for a technical newsgroup suffering from a 
       small number of net abusers. For example, it could be useful for
     sci.physics or 
     comp.lang.ada. <P>

  <LI> <B>"Announce" or "Culture":</B> Each submission triggers a reply
       with a FAQ (or any other text).  All submissions are forwarded to a
       human moderator for review, but some posters are preapproved.
       Some posters may voluntarily request the robomoderator to accept
       only PGP signed articles.</A>

       This configuration is good for an *.announce newsgroup where
       integrity and authentication are very important or a soc.culture.*
       newsgroup severely invaded by flamers, trollers, and forgers.<P>

  <LI> <B>"Religious":</B> Everything goes as long as it is not
       crossposted to any other group.<P>

       This configuration is good for a small cultural or religious 
       newsgroup that offers freedom of speech but does not want any
       crossposted flames.<P>
</UL>

<P>

We shall note that the configurations above can be easily changed by 
changing contents of certain data files, and elements of these 
configurations can be intermixed (i.e., any newsgroup may restrict the
number of crossposts or choose to send FAQ to posters).<P>
