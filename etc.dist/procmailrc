# submissions come in simultaneously and that may impair
# performance of the overall system. You do not REALLY need
# to use these lockfiles otherwise.
#
# STUMP USERS: 
#
# * Go through this file and replace scrm and
#   soc.culture.russian.moderated with appropriate text for
#   your own group.
#
# * Replace "ichudov" with the address of the robomod supporter.
#
# good luck. igor
