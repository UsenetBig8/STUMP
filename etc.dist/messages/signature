Your message has been automatically rejected because it was not signed
by PGP, or because signature did not match. One of the common reasons
for rejection is the failure to submit the right key prior to posting
messages. If this is the reason, simply send your key to
scrm-admin@algebra.com and I will gladly add it to our pblic keyring.

Another possible reason is that you are in the list of people who are 
required to sign their messages and you in fact forgot to do it.

It really may be some screwup on the part of moderators; feel free
to contact us if you think so.
