# This is a crontab file for your newsgroup. Crontab is a Unix table that
# specifies when and which programs should be run at regular intervals.
#
# If you do not know what is cron and crontab, do not bother editing this 
# file. It is not needed to provide the core functionality for your 
# newsgroup.
#
# Its primary use is for regular cleanups, posting monthly summaries
# of approved and rejected messages, and so on. You can set it up
# later when the core of the STUMP functionality is working.
#

# Every sunday at midnight, create and compress an archive of approved
# and rejected postings. Saves disk space.
